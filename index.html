                        <h2>The Sweetest Service</h2>
                        <p>4 Paws for Ability enriches the lives of children with disabilities by training and placing quality, task-trained service dogs. This provides increased independence for the children, and assistance to their families. And 4 Paws also works with veterans from recent conflicts who’ve lost the use of their limbs or their hearing while in active combat.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>When a rare neurological disorder left her confined to a wheelchair, Karen Shirk sought out a service dog. She applied to 3 different agencies and was rejected each time for being “too disabled.” With the help of a professional trainer, Shirk trained her own service dog.</p>
        <p>Later, Shirk formed 4Paws for Ability, which differentiates itself by having no age or disability restrictions. Since founding the organization in 1998, 4 Paws has placed over 650 dogs in seven countries.</p>

                        <h2>Capabilities</h2>
                        <p>The dogs at 4Paws are trained for a variety of services. Most people think service dogs are seeing-eye exclusive, but 4Paws dogs specialize in many other areas. These range from hearing aid dogs, autism and mobility assistance, seizure and diabetic alert dogs, and dogs for veterans.</p>
        <p>4Paws also allows international adoptions, and 95% of its recipients are children. These are just a few of the ways 4Paws stands apart from other service dog organizations.</p>

                    <div class="panel-text">
                        <h2>Successes</h2>
                        <p>Today, 4Paws has a 90% success rate in the placement of service dogs to alert for seizures minutes to several hours before a seizure happens. Though they focus mainly on children, their veteran program has given many veterans their independence back.</p>
        <p>Today, 4Paws places approximately 100 dogs a year, and has retained its primary mission of having no age requirements and never turning down a child who does not “fit” into a traditional category.</p>
